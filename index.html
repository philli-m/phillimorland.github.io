        <p>Artisan Baker - The Moody Baker</p></div>
            <div class="content" id="bakery_content">
                <p>The Moody Baker is an award winning artisan bakery which uses almost completely organic, locally sourced ingredients and where everything is made from scratch on site. My roles included assisting with the bread bake, making pastry, pies, fillings and cakes. I carried out product research and development. Worked markets and festivals as front of house, took orders and managed orders and smaller catering jobs. This job taught me to have a keen eye for detail and gave me my first customer service and sales experience. </p></div>

            <div class="content" id="forensic_content">
                <p>Accredited by the Forensic Science Society, my degree focused on applying scientific techniques to the investigation of crime. We also examined the legal aspects of the discipline and were encouraged to refine our studies in areas of particular interest to us. I decided to concentrate on Anthropological Osteology in my second year solo project and in my third year I chose to focus on the construction, effectiveness and investigation of improvised explosives for my dissertation project.</p></div>

        <p>Sous Chef - River Bar Brasserie</p></div>
            <div class="content" id="chef_content">
                <p>I worked under the head chef in a gastro pub style kitchen, due to its small size, my duties ranged from kitchen porter to grill chef, I carried out kitchen inventory and stock checks. I was responsible for setting up the kitchen in the morning and doing the breakfast shift solo and food prep for the lunch and dinner shifts. I also assisted in the creation of the summer and Christmas menus.</p></div>

     <div class="circle grow" id="office">
     <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Office Manager - Measur Construction Consultants</p></div>
            <div class="content" id="office_content">
                <p>I was responsible for the day to day administration involved in running of the office and business. 
                My duties included managing client invoicing and staff expenses, drafting and editing commercial contracts, managing general upkeep and maintenance of the office, including IT support, office inventory and stationary orders, general reception duties, booking travel, couriers, and meeting rooms. My duties required the daily use of Word, Excel, Outlook, and, database entry. I also assisted the offsite accountant with document compilation, company returns, tax submissions and redesigning the invoice system to go paper free.  I also designed and successfully implemented a company-wide environmental policy and was responsible for company compliance with environmental law and Health and Safety regulations. 
                While at Measur I learnt a great deal about running a business and the organisation required, also the level of independence granted to me as the only support staff member taught me a lot about responsibility that goes with running a business. The relative independence of my role also allowed me to use my initiative and gave me valuable experience in making tough decisions which affected the whole company. Simultaneously, I learnt a great deal about working as part of a larger team, being flexible and knowing when to support and when to lead.</p></div>
